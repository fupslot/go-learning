**Trie** is an efficient information of re**Trie**val data structure. Using Tries, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key lenght). If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to __M* log N__, where **M** is a maximum string length and **N** is number of keys in tree. Using Trie we can search the key in **O(M)** time.
