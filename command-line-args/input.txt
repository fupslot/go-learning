One
common
FAQ
is
how
to
get
the
local
IP
address
of
the
computer.
In
fact,
the
very
question
is
wrong:
a
computer
may
easily
have
multiple
IP
addresses.
In
fact,
a
computer
may
have
multiple
network
adapters,
each
of
which
has
multiple
addresses.
A
single
network
card
may
have
multiple
IP
addresses
as
long
as
they
are
on
separate
logical
networks;
this
is
called
“multihoning”
and
is
sometimes
done
for
security
reasons.
Of
course,
a
computer
may
have
multiple
network
cards
as
well,
especially
when
one
considers
virtual
networks.
